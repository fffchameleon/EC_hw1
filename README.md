# EC_hw1_SCH

This project implements binary GA and real-valued GA in C++17 with different operators to find the minimal solution of the Schwefel function (SCH), $N=10$:

$$ f_{SCH}(\vec{x}) = 418.98291N − \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\sin(\sqrt{| x_i |} ), \quad where -512 \leq x_{i} \leq 511\ $$

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler that supports C++17
- Python 3.x with Matplotlib and Pandas installed
    ```
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```
### Result 
To directly get the result of the compliation, run, plot directly, run the following code:
```
$ make result
```

### Compliation
To compile the project, run the following command in the project root directory:
```
$ make
```
This command will generate the main executable inside the build directory.
### Running the Program
To run the program, use the following command:

```
$ make run
```
This command will execute the main program and move the generated fitness.csv file to the data directory.

### Plotting the Fitness Data
To plot the fitness data, run the following command:

```
$ make plot
```
This command will execute the plot.py Python script inside the plot directory to generate a plot of the fitness data.

### Cleaning up
To clean up the build files, run the following command:

```
make clean
```
This command will remove the object files and the main executable from the build directory.
